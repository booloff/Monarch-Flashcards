## Welcome!

Monarch Flashcards is a flashcard app designed to recreate Quizlet's "write mode" from before 2020 when Quizlet removed that feature.
It is a highly configureable, light-weight, type-the-answer study aid that runs locally on your computer, and gives YOU control over your studies.
Create unlimited decks, for free, with no ads.
Written in Python.

## Features

•	2 study modes: “reveal mode” and “write mode”

•	Extremely configurable

•	simple interface

•	Organize your sets by separating them into different folders

•	Color-codes your decks according to how well you know them, and how long since you last studied them.

•	Create decks with images

•	Decks are stored on your computer, make as many as you like, study them offline

## Download instructions

To download and run the program, you have 3 options:
1) The easiest option is to download the .exe at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vnpsl9aM2cejYebiIZzK4EG7mjk7b_AN?usp=drive_link
   This gives you a single file that lets you run the program at the click of a button. (Currently only supports Windows. Mac version coming soon)

2) You can take the source code and compile it yourself. This will create a .exe file that you can just click to run the program.
    If you don't know how to do this, I advise asking ChatGPT or another Chatbot for help. It's not as difficult as you may think!

3) If you have python installed, you can just run the code through python.

## Background

As a polyglot and avid language learner, I used to use Quizlet daily, and created over 600 Quizlet sets between 2015 - 2020.
I always used "write" mode because the type-the-answer functionality keeps you honest.

When the original founder of Quizlet stepped down in 2020, I was dismayed when the new management removed "write" mode.

Worst of all, other popular flashcard apps like Anki don't offer any type-the-answer options. So I eventually decided to create one myself.
And the result is Monarch Flashcards! :)

## Bugs and feedback

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions please contact me at jonathansheehy1@gmail.com to let me know.
I want it to be great and help as many people as possible, so I need feedback to know where to improve it.

Also, Monarch Flashcards is my first coding project and I'll disclose that I used AI assistance to create it.
All the bugs are Claude's fault, all the parts that work great were written by me.
