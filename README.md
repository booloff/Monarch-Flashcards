== Background ==
As a polyglot and avid language learner, I used to use Quizlet daily, and created over 600 Quizlet sets between 2015 - 2020. I used "write" mode to efficiently learn vocabulary and ace my language classes. But in 2020, "write" mode was removed from Quizlet, and Quizlet started taking a turn for the worse, inserting more and more junk features and distracting pop-ups. Reading between the lines, It appears that behind the scenes, Andrew Sutherland (The founder of Quizlet) either decided to leave Quizlet to pursue other projects, or he was usurped from his control by the board of directors. Either way, without Andrew Sutherland's vision, Quizlet quickly fell apart, and in my view became completely unusable as a study aid. Ever sice Quizlet's decline, I've been unable to find a suitable replacement that allows for type-in-the-answer studying. So I created Monarch Flashcards, to bring back the old Quizlet experience that I used to rely on.
